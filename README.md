# Welcome to this README.
# SPEEDTYPER GAME
# WHY THIS APP?
# I found this code in a YT tutorial from @shakilahmedatik. I started this project because i really like competetive typing. (my best is 110wpm on a  1min text) 
# JOURNEY:
# I tried to understand the code which was kind of hard, because there were a lot of shortcuts. I still had a lot of fun working on this code. After downloading the code, there were some problems which i had to solve. One of them was that Pycharm didn't recognize the library pygame, even tho it was connected to the correct Python path. After re-installing Python and Pycharm it worked perfectly fine.
# FUNCTION:
# After running the code, the SPEEDTYPER app will open another window and will display a random sentence. (which is very often a coding joke) After beginning to type the app will track your WPM, your accuracy and the time you needed to correctly type the sentence.

# I also changed the images, path, fonts, the name of the game and solved some other issues i ran into. 

# In the next few days, i will try to replicate this game using my skills and this code.
